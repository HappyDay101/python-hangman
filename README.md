# python-hangman

This is a simple hangman game implemented in Python. The game allows players to guess letters to uncover a hidden word. Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn.

## How to play
To play the game, follow these steps:
1. Run the `hangman.py` file.
2. The game will prompt you to enter a letter.
3. Enter a letter and press enter.
4. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the hidden word. If it is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.

Hint: Programming languages...

Have fun playing the hangman game!
